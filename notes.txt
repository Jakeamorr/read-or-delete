- New tab page will be a list of links that you want to revisit
- The catch will be that these links will be purged after a set amount of time (week? 2 weeks? month?)
- Clicking the toolbar icon for the extension will add the current web address to the list
    may want a small popup of some kind to notify user the page was successfully added
    * may want to have two separate actions:
        - if the current page is part of the list show a checkmark that can be clicked to remove it from the list
        - if the current page is not part of the list show a plus sign that can be clicked to add it to the list
- Potentially add a small reminder that popups up to let the user know when one of their entries is about to be removed
- Maybe add an archive feature that is a collection of all read articles in case you wish to reference them again
